# SQL Data Analytics Portfolio (PostgreSQL)

Exercises and mini case studies in SQL with a focus on filtering, aggregations (SUM/COUNT/AVG), KPIs and data quality.  
*Current scope:* PostgreSQL, no JOINs yet (aggregations on single tables). JOINs to be added later.

## Topics
- SELECT + WHERE + LIKE/ILIKE
- Numeric & date filters (BETWEEN)
- NULL checks
- Aggregations: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX
- GROUP BY + HAVING
- Data quality checks (basic)

## Structure
- `01-db-setup-erd/` — DB setup notes, CSV import steps, ERD (screenshots ok)
- `02-select-filtering/` — filtering & pattern matching
- `03-aggregations/` — KPIs with SUM/COUNT/AVG (no joins)
- `05-sql-mini-projects/` — small business-style tasks
